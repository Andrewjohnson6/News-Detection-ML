# Fake-News-Detection-ML

## Introduction
The objective of this project was to practice using all of the skills and tools that we have learned over the past semester and implement them into a functional program. I decided that a great way to accomplish this would be to create a fake news detection program using machine learning. This project has been done many times, but for good reason. It showcases all that we have learned so far in our class, as well as using some libraries and techniques that were not fully covered in our discussions. This project provided a great challenge while also helping me to compile my datascience skills together and create something useful.

I decided to do a fake news detection program while reading an article on what makes a good data science project. This project is great for machine learning, as it is boolean based (True or Fake) and has over 40,000 articles to work with.
